# anagrams

An interactive Java program that provides these 2 features:

1 - Checks if two texts are anagrams of each other.
2- Out of all inputs to feature #1: provides all the anagrams for a given string.
Inputs to feature #1 do not need to persisted across multiple runs of your program.
The mode of interactivity is not important. Choose what's easiest and quickest for you,
a simple CLI interface is enough.

For feature #1:
Please follow the definition described in the english wikipedia page for anagram.

For feature #2:
- Given these hypothetical invocations of the feature#1 function -> f1(A, B), f1(A, C), f1(A, D)
- *IF* A, B and D are anagrams
- f2(A) should return [B, D]
- f2(B) should return [A, DI
- f2(C) should return []
